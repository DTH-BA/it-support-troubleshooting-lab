# IT Support Troubleshooting Lab

Welcome to my **IT Support Troubleshooting Lab** — a personal knowledge base and portfolio documenting **real-world technical issues** I’ve encountered and analyzed during my **CompTIA A+ / IT Support learning journey**.

Each case demonstrates **structured troubleshooting methodology**, based on the official **CompTIA A+ Problem-Solving Process**:
1. Identify the problem  
2. Establish a theory of probable cause  
3. Test the theory to determine cause  
4. Establish a plan of action and implement the solution  
5. Verify full system functionality  
6. Document findings, actions, and outcomes
